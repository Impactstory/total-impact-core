# About

This is the latest version of total-impact-core. Installing this provides the 
backend and API for the ImpactStory service. You can then build or run a 
frontend or consume direct from the API into your own frontend.

(Our own frontend is available at [http://github.com/total-impact/total-impact-webapp](http://github.com/total-impact/total-impact-webapp).)

See install instructions at [http://github.com/total-impact/total-impact-deploy](http://github.com/total-impact/total-impact-deploy).)
